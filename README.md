We would like you to write a small (yet realistic) application (that we expect would take roughly 1-2 hour to develop).

Conditions:
Use java & spring
Use an in-memory database

The goal is to create an application that allows uploading and getting a csv file.
The sample csv file can be found here:

The first line of the file are the headers!
Note: The field code is unique

The application allows interaction through a Rest endpoint that allows the user to:

upload the data
Fetch all data
Fetch by code
Delete all data

Data upload:
Store to a database. The in memory database table will contain the fields as described on the csv file


Please provide the source code as a zip or using Git via email to m.karagianni@gerimedica.nl

Good luck and have fun!
